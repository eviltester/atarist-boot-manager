atarist-boot-manager
====================

An Atari ST boot manager that I wrote a long time ago. It lived on my system for about 3 years and worked faultlessly.

Allows selection of Auto progs, Accs, can create files at boot up with commands in them, can copy files at boot up.

No real doc file but includes full 'C' source.

Previously unreleased. Now public domain.
